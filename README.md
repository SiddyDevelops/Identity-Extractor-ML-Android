<p>With everyday advancing technology and growing sectors in Machine Learning, it has become eaier for developers to use this techology to ease their daily life tasks. We require our identification card in schools, offices, while travelling and booking movie tickets, etc.
Keeping this in mind, I have created an android app which uses the latest technology of ML-text recognition system to read inforamtions like Name, Date of Birth, Address, etc. from our ID Card and save it for later use. All you have to do is click a picture of your ID card.</p>
